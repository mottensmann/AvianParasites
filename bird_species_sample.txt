In order to have an idea of the factor and their modalities we should consider,
we should find for those species:

	- habitat type (the more precise possible, i.e. coniferous vs deciduous forest; marsh grasslands vs reed, etc...)

	- breeding site (ground, shrubs, cavity etc...) 

	- distribution zone: we already have the coordinates provided by the study that investigate
		this bird species, the continent, country and if the bird is migratory or resident.
		=> that should be enough to estimate if two species overlap. 

	- other factors that can explain variation in the probability of parasite transmission.
